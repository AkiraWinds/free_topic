This is a sample text document for testing the GraphRAG database system.

The GraphRAG system combines the power of knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to create a comprehensive information retrieval and storage solution.

Key features include:
- Data preprocessing and validation
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Intelligent chunking strategies using LangChain
- Vector embeddings generation
- Knowledge graph construction with Neo4j
- Metadata extraction and management

This system is designed to handle various data sources including local files, databases, and remote datasets like the Australian Legal Corpus from Hugging Face.

The pipeline processes documents through multiple stages:
1. Loading and validation
2. Cleaning and normalization
3. Chunking into manageable pieces
4. Generating embeddings
5. Extracting metadata and entities
6. Storing in a graph database

Users can query the system using semantic search or explore the knowledge graph to discover relationships between entities.
