(2) No security is to be required from a parent under this section unless the parent has been required to attend before the court and has had an opportunity to be heard. (3) A court must not take any action against a child for the failure of a parent of the child to comply with an undertaking under this section. (4) Such part of any security required under this section as the court may determine is to be forfeited to the Crown if the person giving it fails to fulfil the obligation to ensure the child is of good behaviour. (5) The court may specify which parent or parents are subject to any condition imposed under subsection (1).",
