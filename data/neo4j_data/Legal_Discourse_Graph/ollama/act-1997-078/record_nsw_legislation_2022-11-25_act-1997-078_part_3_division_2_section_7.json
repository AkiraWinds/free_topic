(2) In deciding which persons should be designated under this section in respect of an Aboriginal child, the Director-General is to take into account (so far as they are applicable) the principles for placement of Aboriginal children set out in section 13 of the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998. (3) In deciding which persons should be designated under this section in respect of children other than Aboriginal children, the Director-General is to take into account the principle that children with a particular cultural heritage should preferably be placed with persons who are of a similar background or who understand their special needs.",
