(2) A police officer who escorts a person to the residence of a parent of the person or his or her care residence must not leave the person at that residence unless— (a) the parent or carer of the person or some other responsible adult is present at the residence and is able and willing to care for the person, or (b) the police officer is satisfied that the person may safely be left at the residence in the absence of a responsible adult. (3) If the police officer is unable to escort the person to, or leave the person, at a place referred to in subsection (2), the police officer may escort (or arrange for another police officer to escort) the person to the residence of a close relative nominated by the person and leave the person there.
